## Introduction

Diamond Data Analysis Report enabled developing data products using shiny apps being embeded within RMarkDown.

Using PageUp and PageDown keys all the slides can be traversed.

## Overview

- Links for the Application

**I failed to upload my shiny app into shinyapps.io due to the error, which happened when I tried to connect my Rstudio to shinyapps.io**

The problem is: when i try to install libcur3, all R packages have to be removed.
